# RESUME-projrct
 Hi everyone, as the final project and a key takeaway from my HTML learning journey, I have created a personal Resume Website. This website showcases authentic information about me, my background, my interests, and my professional journey so far. It serves as a digital representation of who I am, my skills, and the milestones I’ve achieved. 
I would be truly grateful if you could take a moment to explore it. Your feedback means a lot to me, and I warmly welcome any suggestions, improvements, or creative ideas you might have to make it even better. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
